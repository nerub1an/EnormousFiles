# EnormousFiles

Creates a file of specified size started 1Mb generated by random lines in format '{number}. {name}' (for example "1233. Hello world")
Uses only English characters (A-z)

Sorts such files based on the count of processor and RAM:
* FileSize <= 2Gb - sorts in memory
* FileSize > 2Gb - splits to bathes sort it, writes to temp files, and merges into one big file

If ProcessorCount > 1 then sorting use multi-threading.

If FileSize > ~104Gb (if each letter more than 2Gb) possible to slow execution time
because sorting happened for each letter in memory limited by 2Gb and if one letter batchSize > 2Gb sorting is happened line by line

Possible to improve the problem described above to sort not letter by letter but for example fewer batch size (A, AA, AB,..., Az, B, BA,..., zz).
Then it will be fast for files less than 52 * 52 * 2Gb
